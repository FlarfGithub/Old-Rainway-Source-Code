Free to use no credit needed!
This is Old Rainway's full src.
I am sorry about the launcher but it is outdated and wont work with hats and clothing so you will probably have to modify launcher. If you do not know what this is, rainway is a project that revives older versions of roblox (Old Roblox Revival). If you want forums use PhpBB, or other forum plugins. Or just make your own forum lol. PLEASE remember that this source is as of 8/16/2021 and it won't get updated! Just a warning that this is a vulnerable source and if you use it you should modify it, i make better code nowadays.
If you use this source you should hella modify it cause it is dog shit.
