You will receive invoices and may be able to deduct them as expenses.%0a%0a[[http://www.pmwiki.org/petko|Petko Yotov]] has been the PmWiki core developer, release manager and webmaster since 2009, and has been publishing addons, updating documentation and providing support since [[https://www.pmwiki.org/search-ml.php?action=search&q=5ko+from%253A5ko+until%253A2006|2006]]. Financial contributions allow Petko to dedicate more time and effort to the project, reduce other "real" (paid) work and still take care of family, rent, and food. Payments also reduce the tensions among family, work, and PmWiki and reduce burnout on the project.%0a%0a''Do not feel obligated to make payments: you can always get PmWiki and support for free. This page exists to allow people or companies who '''want''' to contribute to do it legally and easily.''%0a%0a(:details summary="Details...":)%0aPayments can be made via SEPA/IBAN bank transfer, via Credit Card or via PayPal, and you will receive an invoice.%0a* '''SEPA/IBAN bank transfer''': the best and least expensive payment from a bank account in EUR is via a SEPA/IBAN bank transfer. Please contact mailto:5ko@5ko.fr for details. European companies and individuals from the EuroZone may prefer this method. Non-EU companies can also use this method, contact your bank for confirmation.%0a* '''Payment cards''': Credit or Debit cards, or PayPal accounts can be used to make payments, fill in the form.%0a%0aWhile development, documentation, maintenance, communications, testing, and a host of other costs vary considerably according to the activity and complexity, below are some rough details on what your payments can allow Petko to perform:%0a%0a* 320 EUR = a day's work, eg.
